             <p>The gates and doors were barred
                And all the windows fastened down
                I spent the night in sleeplessness
                And rose at every sound
                Half in hope of sorrow
                And half in fear the day
                Would find the soldiers breakin' through

              I heard something at the wall
              The gate began to rattle
              And a voice began to call
              I hurried to the window
              Looked down into the street
              Expecting swords and torches
              And the sound of soldiers' feet</p>

                She said they've moved Him in the night
                And none of us know where

               We found the stone and empty tomb
               Just the way that Mary said
               But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
               Was just an empty shell

               Circumstance and speculation
               Couldn't lift me very high
